# UltraWealth — Investor Demo Build Prompt (Manus)
## “Everything Else Is Outdated” Edition

---

## ROLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You are designing a **visual investor demo**, not a full application.

This demo exists to create one reaction in under 60 seconds:

> “Everything else in wealth software now feels outdated.”

You are **not** optimising for:
- feature completeness
- retail onboarding
- edge cases
- configuration depth

You are optimising for:
- inevitability
- clarity
- calm authority
- system-level thinking

---

## DEMO SCOPE (LOCKED)

The demo represents:

- **One individual Australian client**
- No joint accounts
- No trusts
- No SMSFs
- No businesses
- No advice mode
- No product selection
- No performance metrics

The demo must feel **complete** for one person.

---

## CORE THESIS (MUST BE FELT, NOT EXPLAINED)

UltraWealth is not:
- a bank
- a trading platform
- a robo-advisor

UltraWealth is:

> **A goal-native wealth operating system where money moves deterministically, decisions are provable, and progress is visible without noise.**

Do not explain this explicitly.  
Make it *obvious through structure*.

---

## VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (CRITICAL)

The demo must feel like **infrastructure**, not an app.

Required traits:
- Dark, quiet background
- Large typography
- Generous whitespace
- One dominant object per screen
- Minimal colour
- Card-based containment
- No charts
- No dashboards
- No navigation chrome in demo mode

If it feels friendly or helpful, it is wrong.  
If it feels calm, inevitable, and serious, it is right.

---

## DEMO STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

### Screen 1 — Orientation
- Headline: **Goals first. Money follows.**
- One primary goal card
- Progress only (%, status, target year)
- No balances, no returns, no charts

The viewer must immediately understand:
> “This is not about accounts or markets.”

---

### Screen 2 — Mechanism
Show one flow only:

Income → Goal Accounts → Portfolio

With subtle chips:
- Rules applied
- Policy check passed
- Evidence recorded

Three supporting pillars (secondary):
- Goals, not accounts
- Automatic allocation
- Evidence by default

Stillness implies confidence.

---

### Screen 3 — Proof
- Decision & evidence timeline
- Past-tense neutral events
- Timestamps
- Rule names
- Policy outcomes
- Short hashes

CTA:
**Export Evidence Pack**

The existence of the button matters more than its format.

The viewer should think:
> “This would survive regulators.”

---

## LANGUAGE RULES (ABSOLUTE)

Forbidden:
balance, net worth, returns, performance, benchmark, optimise,
AI-driven, recommendation, advice, ETF, fund, asset allocation

Allowed:
goals, rules, progress, evidence, policy, replay, audit, deterministic

Declarative > explanatory.

---

## INTERACTION MODEL

- Scroll only
- No branching
- No settings
- No decisions
- This is a **presentation**, not a playground

---

## FINAL CHECK

Ask before finishing:

> “If I showed this next to any existing wealth platform, would theirs feel immediately legacy?”

If not, remove more.
