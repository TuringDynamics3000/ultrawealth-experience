==========================================

Date: 2026-01-02
Branch: feat/how-it-works

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
---------------------
✅ Section appears immediately below the WOW Goal Cards Carousel
✅ Full-width section with white background (strong contrast from carousel's #F9F7F2)
✅ Centered horizontal flow layout displaying correctly

FLOW STEPS DISPLAYED:
1. "Money in" - "Your income arrives as usual."
2. "Goals update" - "Your goals stay on track automatically."
3. "Portfolio adjusts" - "Everything stays aligned behind the scenes."

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS:
- Large, confident typography for step labels
- Smaller, muted text for descriptions
- Arrow separators (→) visible between steps on desktop
- Generous whitespace above and below
- Clean, calm aesthetic - feels like a "deep breath"

COMPLIANCE WITH SPEC:
✅ No charts, numbers, or icons implying transactions
✅ No technical terminology (AI, algorithms, optimization, etc.)
✅ Plain language, declarative tone
✅ No promises or urgency
✅ One sentence per step
✅ Semantic HTML with aria-label

The section successfully communicates: "I don't need to manage this. It just stays on track."
