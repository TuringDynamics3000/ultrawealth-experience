  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Humanist FinTech**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Radical Warmth**: Every interaction should feel like a handshake, not a transaction.
  2. **Clarity over Density**: Information is revealed only when needed; the default state is calm.
  3. **Organic Structure**: Layouts flow naturally rather than being rigidly grid-locked.
  4. **Optimistic Realism**: Visuals are grounded in reality but bathed in a hopeful light.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: **Oxidised Bronze (#6F6A63)** - Grounded, timeless, "private-bank correct". Used for text and subtle emphasis.
  - **Secondary**: **Soft Cream / Warm Beige (#F9F7F2)** - The canvas. Replaces clinical white with something that feels like high-quality paper.
  - **Accent**: **Muted Terracotta (#C88D74)** - For warmth and human touch, used sparingly for the goal card.
  - **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of a sunny Sunday morning—relaxed, secure, and full of potential.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Asymmetric Fluidity**.
  - The hero image dominates the right side but bleeds organically into the background.
  - Text is left-aligned but breathes with generous margins.
  - The "Goal Card" floats, breaking the boundary between image and text, creating depth.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Soft-Edge Cards**: No harsh borders; cards float with deep, diffuse shadows.
  2. **Natural Light Overlays**: Subtle gradients that mimic sunlight hitting a surface.
  3. **Hand-Drawn Underlines**: Occasional imperfect lines to emphasize key human concepts (like "Goals").

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Gentle & Deliberate**.
  - Buttons don't "click"; they press down softly.
  - Hover states are slow fades, not instant switches.
  - Scrolling feels weighted and smooth.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements drift in from slightly different directions (up, left) with staggered timing to feel like a breeze.
  - **Hover**: The Goal Card gently bobs or tilts in 3D space when interacted with.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Fraunces** (Soft Serif) - For that "editorial" and "human" touch.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Clean Sans) - For absolute legibility, but with slightly looser tracking.

  **Design Movement**: **Swiss International Style (Warm Edition)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: The message is the hero; design gets out of the way.
  2. **Grid with Soul**: A strict grid underpins everything, but elements are allowed to span across it playfully.
  3. **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size and weight do the heavy lifting, not decoration.
  4. **Honest Materials**: Digital "materials" (colors, shapes) are used without trying to mimic physical ones too closely.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: **Oxidised Bronze (#6F6A63)** - The anchor.
  - **Secondary**: **Pale Slate Blue (#E8ECF2)** - A cool, calm background that contrasts with the warm hero image.
  - **Accent**: **Burnt Orange (#D97757)** - A high-energy pop for the CTA to cut through the calm.
  - **Intent**: To convey precision and reliability, softened by the human imagery.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Modular Asymmetry**.
  - A strong vertical axis divides the screen (Golden Ratio).
  - Text locks to the grid; the image breaks it.
  - The Goal Card is a "violation" of the grid, drawing immediate attention.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Big Type**: Headlines are massive, confident, and tight.
  2. **Geometric Shapes**: Subtle circles or squares in the background to guide the eye.
  3. **High Contrast Lines**: Thin, sharp dividers to separate sections cleanly.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Snappy & Precise**.
  - Interactions are instant and crisp.
  - Focus states are high-contrast outlines.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in from the bottom with a quick, springy ease.
  - **Hover**: Buttons fill with color instantly (solid to filled).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Helvetica Now Display** (or similar neo-grotesque) - Bold, tight, authoritative.
  - **Body**: **Roboto** - Neutral, readable, familiar.

  **Design Movement**: **Ethereal Minimalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Weightlessness**: The interface should feel like it's floating.
  2. **Light as Material**: Light and shadow define form, not borders.
  3. **Focus through Reduction**: Remove everything until only the essential remains.
  4. **Serene Confidence**: Quiet design speaks louder.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: **Oxidised Bronze (#6F6A63)** - Used very sparingly for text.
  - **Secondary**: **Pure White (#FFFFFF)** - Maximum breathability.
  - **Accent**: **Soft Sage (#A3B18A)** - For a touch of nature and growth (money growing).
  - **Intent**: To create a "zen garden" for finances—stress-free and pure.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Centralized Focus**.
  - Everything radiates from the center.
  - The hero image is a soft vignette, fading into the white.
  - Text is centered and balanced.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Glassmorphism**: The Goal Card is a frosted glass pane, blurring the background.
  2. **Soft Glows**: Buttons emit a faint glow rather than having a shadow.
  3. **Generous Leading**: Text lines are spaced far apart for easy reading.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Fluid & Ethereal**.
  - Elements morph and change shape fluidly.
  - Cursors might have a subtle trailing effect.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: A slow, long fade-in for everything. No movement, just appearing.
  - **Hover**: Elements lift slightly and cast a softer, larger shadow.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Cormorant Garamond** - Elegant, tall, sophisticated.
  - **Body**: **Lato** - Light weight, airy.
