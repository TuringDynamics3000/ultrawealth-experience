  **Design Movement**: **Immersive Realism (Revolut Style)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Hero as Canvas**: The image is not a component; it is the environment. The UI lives *inside* the image.
  2. **Bold Typography**: Headlines are massive, white, and interact with the sky/negative space of the image.
  3. **Floating Glass/White UI**: Functional elements (cards, buttons) are stark white or frosted glass to pop against the rich background.
  4. **Unapologetic Modernity**: No "soft" beige backgrounds. Full bleed, high contrast.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: **White (#FFFFFF)** - For all primary text and UI cards against the image.
  - **Secondary**: **Sky Blue (from image)** - The background blends into the image.
  - **Accent**: **Oxidised Bronze (#6F6A63)** - STRICTLY for text *inside* the white cards to maintain the "private bank" feel within the modern shell.
  - **Intent**: To feel expansive, limitless, and incredibly premium.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Vertical Integration**.
  - Top: Massive headline in the sky.
  - Middle: The subject (woman) anchors the center.
  - Bottom/Overlay: The Goal Card floats over the subject or at the bottom, anchoring the concept of "wealth" to the "person".

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Glass/White Pills**: Buttons and tags are fully rounded pills.
  2. **Depth Layers**: Text -> Image -> Card. A clear Z-index hierarchy.
  3. **Transparency**: The nav bar is transparent; the content flows behind it.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Fluid & Direct**.
  - Parallax scrolling.
  - Cards slide up over the image on scroll.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Inter** (Bold/Display) - Switched from Fraunces to match the Revolut "clean & bold" aesthetic.
  - **Body**: **Inter** - Clean, legible.
