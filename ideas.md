  **Design Movement**: **Revolut Replica (Face-First Layout)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Face is Sacred**: The subject's face is the emotional anchor. NO UI elements shall obscure it.
  2. **Torso UI**: The "Big Number" and "Pill" sit strictly below the chin line, overlaying the clothing/chest.
  3. **The Frame**: A thin, rounded white border frames the subject, but the top edge is high enough to clear the head or cuts through the forehead if zoomed in (Revolut style often crops tight, but we will keep it safe).
  4. **Top-Heavy Text**: Headline sits above the frame entirely.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: **White (#FFFFFF)** - For the frame, the text, the pills.
  - **Secondary**: **Deep Sky Blue** - The background.
  - **Accent**: **Oxidised Bronze (#6F6A63)** - Used ONLY for the text inside the white "notification" card at the bottom.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **The Portrait Overlay**.
  - **Layer 1 (Back)**: Full screen sky + woman.
  - **Layer 2 (Middle)**: A large, thin white border (rounded rectangle) centered on the woman.
  - **Layer 3 (Front)**: 
    - Top (Outside Frame): Headline.
    - Center (Inside Frame, Below Chin): "Goal Value" ($81,600) + "Home Deposit" Pill.
    - Bottom (Inside Frame): "Status" Notification Card.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **The Border**: A 1px white/transparent border with large border-radius.
  2. **The Center Pill**: A white button saying "Home Deposit" (replacing "Accounts").
  3. **The Bottom Toast**: A white card showing "+$5,100" or similar progress.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Inter** (Bold) - Clean, standard, impactful.
  - **Numbers**: **Inter** (Bold) - For the big dollar amount.
