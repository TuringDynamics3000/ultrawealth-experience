# Betterment Goals-Based Planning Framework — Key Insights for UltraWealth

## Betterment's 5-Step Framework
1. **Identify** — Help clients identify goals (retirement, education, safety net, home, major purchases)
2. **Define** — S.M.A.R.T. goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-related
3. **Prioritize** — Drag-and-drop reordering; three approaches: Mathematical, Time-based, Emotional
4. **Save** — "Savings waterfall" — money flows to highest priority goal first
5. **Adjust** — Goals are living/breathing; modify target, date, reprioritize, move money between goals

## Insights We Can Apply to UltraWealth

### 1. Goal Identification (Prompting)
- **Betterment insight:** Clients have "blind spots" — simply asking "what are your goals?" doesn't work
- **Their solution:** Prompt with common goal types (retirement, education, safety net, home, major purchases)
- **UltraWealth application:** Consider pre-populated goal templates or a "goal picker" during onboarding

### 2. Goal Definition (S.M.A.R.T.)
- **Betterment insight:** Clients struggle to transform "nebulous dreams into measurable goals"
- **Their solution:** Each goal gets: target amount + target date (can be updated anytime)
- **UltraWealth application:** Already doing this ✓ — but consider adding "smart defaults" (e.g., "Emergency fund = 3-6 months expenses")

### 3. Goal Prioritization
- **Betterment insight:** When cash flow is limited, prioritization determines where money goes first
- **Their solution:** Drag-and-drop reordering + "savings waterfall" concept
- **UltraWealth application:** 
  - Add priority ordering to goals
  - Show how incoming funds would be allocated based on priority
  - Three prioritization modes: Mathematical (returns), Time-based (urgency), Emotional (values)

### 4. Goal Forecaster / Projection
- **Betterment insight:** Show "percentage likelihood of reaching the goal"
- **Their solution:** Goal Forecaster uses current balance, target, time horizon, expected growth
- **UltraWealth application:**
  - We show "Projected: Oct 2026" — but could add probability/confidence
  - Show scenarios: "If you save $X/month, you'll reach this goal by Y"
  - **Caution:** This edges toward advice territory — keep it factual/mathematical

### 5. "On Track" Visualization
- **Betterment insight:** Simple "On track" status with trajectory chart (Today → Target Date)
- **Their visual:** Person looking through binoculars at upward trajectory
- **UltraWealth application:** Our "Within target range" / "Behind schedule" is similar — could add a simple trajectory visualization

### 6. Flexibility / Adjustment
- **Betterment insight:** "Life happens and goals can change" — plans are "living, breathing"
- **Their solution:** Easy to modify target, date, reprioritize, move money between goals
- **UltraWealth application:** Add ability to:
  - Edit goal parameters
  - Transfer funds between goals
  - Archive/delete goals
  - Show history of goal changes

### 7. Recurring Deposits
- **Betterment insight:** Set up recurring deposits per goal to "automate the client's savings"
- **UltraWealth application:** Add scheduled contribution rules per goal
