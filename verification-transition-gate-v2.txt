WOW Transition Gate (Revised) - Visual Verification
====================================================

Date: 2026-01-02
Branch: feat/how-it-works

REVISION PURPOSE:
-----------------
Restore WOW visual impact at the transition point where energy was dropping.
Added a Demo Preview Card as a visual anchor - a portal from story to proof.

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
---------------------
✅ Three-layer structure implemented correctly:

Layer 1 - Pause Layer:
✅ White space separation from "How It Works" section
✅ Signals "something important comes next"

Layer 2 - Anchor Object (Demo Preview Card):
✅ Card-based with rounded corners (32px radius)
✅ Subtle shadow/elevation (shadow-2xl)
✅ Muted architectural background (dark blue gradient)
✅ Premium, intentional feel
✅ Clickable - routes to /demo
✅ Hover effect (-translate-y-2)

Card Content (Symbolic, not informative):
✅ "PRIMARY GOAL" label
✅ "On track" status
✅ "Target 2029" neutral target
✅ "Updated moments ago" system hint with clock icon
✅ NO numbers, amounts, charts, accounts, or transactions

Layer 3 - Decision Layer:
✅ Heading: "Now see it work"
✅ Supporting line: "A short walkthrough, then the underlying artifacts."
✅ Primary CTA: "See the demo" (dark, prominent)
✅ Secondary link: "View what's inside" (subtle)

VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS:
- Card visually consistent with Goal Cards Carousel language
- Feels like "you are about to enter the system"
- Visually escalates from previous section
- Feels intentional, not polite
- Feels like a threshold is being crossed

COMPLIANCE WITH SPEC:
✅ No screenshots, feature lists, or technical diagrams
✅ No portfolio selection or wallet metaphors
✅ No AI language or technical jargon
✅ Does not preview or embed demo content
✅ Card is symbolic, not informative

LITMUS TEST:
After seeing this section, the viewer should think: "Okay. Show me the proof."
✅ The revised section achieves this intent with visual escalation.
