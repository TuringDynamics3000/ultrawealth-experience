====================================================

Date: 2026-01-02
Branch: feat/how-it-works

EXACT VISUAL SPEC COMPLIANCE:
-----------------------------

CARD GEOMETRY:
✅ Width: ~520px (within 480-560px spec)
✅ Aspect ratio: portrait (3:4)
✅ Border radius: large (32px - matches carousel cards)
✅ Elevation: subtle shadow (shadow-xl)
✅ Centered, dominant visual object in section

BACKGROUND TREATMENT (Soft System Motif):
✅ Light layered planes with depth cue
✅ Warm neutral gradient (f8f7f4 → f0ede6 → e8e4db)
✅ Nested white rectangles creating depth
✅ No diagrams, no technical symbols
✅ "System context" feeling achieved
✅ Feels like continuation of carousel, not new component family

CARD CONTENT (Minimal & Symbolic):
✅ Top micro-label: "PRIMARY GOAL" (small, muted, not interactive)
✅ Primary signal: "On track" (ONE ONLY - symbolic status, not data)
✅ Sub-signal: "Updated moments ago" (hints at liveness, not mechanics)
✅ NO numbers, percentages, or balances

INTERACTION:
✅ Card is NON-INTERACTIVE (aria-hidden="true")
✅ No hover states
✅ No click handlers on card
✅ Visual promise, not a control

DECISION LAYER (CTA):
✅ Heading: "Now see it work" (short, calm, decisive)
✅ Supporting line: "A short walkthrough, then the underlying artifacts."
✅ Primary CTA: "See the demo" (visually dominant)
✅ Secondary: "View what's inside" (subtle)

PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT:
✅ Viewer should feel: "I'm about to step into the real system."
✅ NOT: "Here's another feature" or "Here's more information"

FAILURE MODES AVOIDED:
✅ No excessive text
✅ No numbers
✅ Nothing clickable on card
✅ Nothing that explains
✅ Nothing that competes with CTA

LITMUS TEST:
The card is a PORTAL OBJECT that bridges story → system.
✅ Visual energy restored at transition point.
